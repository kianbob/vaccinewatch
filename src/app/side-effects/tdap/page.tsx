        <p>
          Tdap is recommended during weeks 27-36 of every pregnancy to protect newborns from 
          whooping cough (pertussis). This means a large portion of Tdap VAERS reports come 
          from pregnant women, which may include pregnancy complications that are 
          <strong>coincidental</strong> rather than vaccine-caused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Large-scale studies have found Tdap during pregnancy to be safe, with no increased 
          risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or small-for-gestational-age births.

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>2026 Safety Monitoring Update</h2>
        <p>
          As of mid-2026, the Tdap vaccine continues to be monitored through VAERS and complementary
          surveillance systems including the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and the Clinical Immunization Safety
          Assessment (CISA) project. No new safety signals have been identified in recent data that would change
          the established safety profile of this vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The HHS administration&apos;s announced development of AI-powered VAERS analysis tools may provide
          additional insights into Tdap vaccine adverse event patterns. These tools aim to detect
          subtle signals that traditional statistical methods might miss, though their implementation timeline
          and methodology remain under development.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s worth noting that VAERS reporting for routine vaccines like Tdap has remained
          stable through the post-pandemic period. While COVID-19 vaccine reports surged and then declined,
          reporting patterns for established childhood and adult vaccines have been remarkably consistent,
          suggesting that the VAERS system continues to function as designed for ongoing safety surveillance.
        </p>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Understanding VAERS Data for Tdap</h2>
        <p>
          When interpreting VAERS data for Tdap vaccines, several key principles apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reports ≠ Causation:</strong> A VAERS report means an event occurred after vaccination.
          It does not establish that the vaccine caused the event. Many reported symptoms are common health
          occurrences that would happen regardless of vaccination.</li>
          <li><strong>No denominator:</strong> VAERS does not track the number of doses administered. Without
          knowing how many people received the vaccine, raw report counts cannot be used to calculate risk rates
          or compare safety across vaccines.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-administration:</strong> Many vaccines are given at the same visit. When a VAERS report
          lists multiple vaccines, it&apos;s impossible to determine which vaccine (if any) was responsible for
          the reported adverse event.</li>
          <li><strong>Reporting variability:</strong> Healthcare provider awareness, media attention, and public
          concern all influence how many reports are filed. Changes in report volume may reflect changes in
          reporting behavior rather than changes in actual safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>How to Use This Data Responsibly</h2>
        <p>
          VAERS data is most useful as a starting point for conversation with your healthcare provider, not as
          a basis for medical decisions. If you&apos;re concerned about Tdap vaccine side effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss your specific risk factors with your doctor or pharmacist</li>
          <li>Ask about the relative risks of the disease the vaccine prevents vs. the vaccine itself</li>
          <li>Consider your age, health status, and any previous vaccine reactions</li>
          <li>Remember that clinical trials and post-market studies provide much stronger safety evidence than VAERS alone</li>
        </ul>
