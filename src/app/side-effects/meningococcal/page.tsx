          Meningococcal vaccines protect against bacterial meningitis — a rare but potentially fatal 
          infection. Routinely given to adolescents at ages 11-12 and 16, and required by many colleges 
          for dorm residents. VAERS contains over 36,000 reports across all meningococcal vaccine types.

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Types of Meningococcal Vaccines</h2>
        <p>There are two main categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MenACWY (conjugate):</strong> Menactra, Menveo, MenQuadfi — protects against serogroups A, C, W, Y. This is the routine adolescent vaccine.</li>
          <li><strong>MenB (serogroup B):</strong> Bexsero, Trumenba — protects against serogroup B. Recommended for teens/young adults at increased risk or during outbreaks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          MenB vaccines tend to have more local side effects (injection site pain) than MenACWY vaccines, 
          which is reflected in VAERS reporting patterns.
        </p>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Expected Side Effects</h2>
        <p><strong>Very common:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Injection site pain (up to 50%+ for MenB)</li>
          <li>Fatigue and malaise</li>
          <li>Headache</li>
          <li>Muscle pain</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Common:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fever</li>
          <li>Nausea</li>
          <li>Joint pain</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Rare:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guillain-Barré Syndrome (Menactra specifically monitored for this)</li>
          <li>Severe allergic reaction</li>
          <li>Syncope (fainting) — common in adolescents after any injection, not vaccine-specific</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Fainting in Adolescents</h2>
        <p>
          A notable portion of meningococcal vaccine VAERS reports involve syncope (fainting). This is 
          not specific to meningococcal vaccines — adolescents faint after any injection at much higher 
          rates than other age groups. The CDC recommends a 15-minute observation period after vaccinating 
          adolescents for this reason.
        </p>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Meningococcal disease is rare (about 300-400 cases/year in the U.S.) but devastating — 
          10-15% of cases are fatal, and up to 20% of survivors have permanent complications like 
          limb amputation, hearing loss, or brain damage. The vaccine has dramatically reduced cases
          in the age groups most at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          MenACWY is routine at ages 11-12 with a booster at 16. See where meningococcal vaccines fit on the{' '}

        <strong>⚠️ Remember:</strong> VAERS reports show correlation, not causation. A report filed

      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-12">
        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>2026 Safety Monitoring Update</h2>
        <p>
          As of mid-2026, the meningococcal vaccine continues to be monitored through VAERS and complementary
          surveillance systems including the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and the Clinical Immunization Safety
          Assessment (CISA) project. No new safety signals have been identified in recent data that would change
          the established safety profile of this vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The HHS administration&apos;s announced development of AI-powered VAERS analysis tools may provide
          additional insights into meningococcal vaccine adverse event patterns. These tools aim to detect
          subtle signals that traditional statistical methods might miss, though their implementation timeline
          and methodology remain under development.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s worth noting that VAERS reporting for routine vaccines like meningococcal has remained
          stable through the post-pandemic period. While COVID-19 vaccine reports surged and then declined,
          reporting patterns for established childhood and adult vaccines have been remarkably consistent,
          suggesting that the VAERS system continues to function as designed for ongoing safety surveillance.
        </p>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>Understanding VAERS Data for meningococcal</h2>
        <p>
          When interpreting VAERS data for meningococcal vaccines, several key principles apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reports ≠ Causation:</strong> A VAERS report means an event occurred after vaccination.
          It does not establish that the vaccine caused the event. Many reported symptoms are common health
          occurrences that would happen regardless of vaccination.</li>
          <li><strong>No denominator:</strong> VAERS does not track the number of doses administered. Without
          knowing how many people received the vaccine, raw report counts cannot be used to calculate risk rates
          or compare safety across vaccines.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-administration:</strong> Many vaccines are given at the same visit. When a VAERS report
          lists multiple vaccines, it&apos;s impossible to determine which vaccine (if any) was responsible for
          the reported adverse event.</li>
          <li><strong>Reporting variability:</strong> Healthcare provider awareness, media attention, and public
          concern all influence how many reports are filed. Changes in report volume may reflect changes in
          reporting behavior rather than changes in actual safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className={playfairDisplay.className}>How to Use This Data Responsibly</h2>
        <p>
          VAERS data is most useful as a starting point for conversation with your healthcare provider, not as
          a basis for medical decisions. If you&apos;re concerned about meningococcal vaccine side effects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss your specific risk factors with your doctor or pharmacist</li>
          <li>Ask about the relative risks of the disease the vaccine prevents vs. the vaccine itself</li>
          <li>Consider your age, health status, and any previous vaccine reactions</li>
          <li>Remember that clinical trials and post-market studies provide much stronger safety evidence than VAERS alone</li>
